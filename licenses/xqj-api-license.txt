patent claims that they own, or have the authority to license, for which there is no
technically feasible way of avoiding infringement in the course of implementing the
Specification ("Necessary Patent Claims").
The licenses and agreement to license set forth above are conditional upon licensee’s
offering a license, on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to Necessary Patent
Claims that they own or have the authority to license to make, have made, use, sell and

above, to all other licensees to the Specification who agree to offer a similar license and
not initiating any claim that either Specification Lead, has, in the course of performing its
responsibilities as the Specification Lead, induced any other entity to infringe the
licensee’s patent rights.
